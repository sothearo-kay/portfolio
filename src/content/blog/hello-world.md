Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm **Sothearo**, a frontend developer based in Phnom Penh who's passionate about crafting exceptional web experiences. Welcome to my corner of the internet where I share insights, discoveries, and lessons learned from building modern web applications.

## What You'll Find Here

This blog is where I explore:

- **Framework comparisons** - React, Vue, Svelte, and Astro in real-world scenarios
- **TypeScript patterns** that solve actual problems
- **Performance optimization** techniques and case studies
- **Component architecture** and design system principles
- **Project breakdowns** - behind-the-scenes of my builds
- **AI development workflows** with Claude and ChatGPT
- **Modern CSS** tricks and user interface techniques

## My Approach

I believe in choosing the right tool for the job. You can see my full tech stack on the [homepage](/), but what matters most is understanding **when and why** to use each technologyâ€”whether it's Astro's performance for content sites, React's ecosystem for complex apps, or TypeScript's safety for large codebases.

## Why This Matters

In today's rapidly evolving web landscape, staying current isn't just about learning new frameworksâ€”it's about understanding **when and why** to use them. Each tool in my arsenal serves a specific purpose, whether it's Astro's stellar performance for content sites, React's ecosystem for complex apps, or TypeScript's safety net for large codebases.

## What's Coming Next

I'm particularly excited to explore:

- **Nuxt Nitro & H3** - The powerful server engine and web framework behind Nuxt
- **Island Architecture** patterns with Astro
- **Server Components** and the future of React
- **CSS Container Queries** in production
- **AI-assisted development** workflows and best practices

## Let's Connect

Building great web experiences is collaborative work. Whether you're a fellow developer, designer, or just someone curious about web technology, I'd love to connect and learn from your perspective.

**Code by day, manga by night** - when I'm not crafting web experiences, you'll find me diving into great stories. Feel free to check out my [manga recommendations](/manga) or connect with me on [GitHub](https://github.com/sothearo-kay) and [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/kaysothearo19).

Here's to building a more beautiful, accessible, and performant webâ€”one component at a time! ðŸš€
