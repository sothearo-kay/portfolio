Astro is a modern web framework that delivers lightning-fast performance by shipping zero JavaScript by default. In this post, we'll explore why Astro is an excellent choice for building content-focused websites.

## What makes Astro special?

Astro uses a unique "islands architecture" that allows you to build your site with your favorite UI components (React, Vue, Svelte, etc.) while shipping minimal JavaScript to the browser.

## Key Features

- **Zero JS by default**: Only ship JavaScript when you need it
- **Component Islands**: Mix and match different UI frameworks
- **Built-in optimizations**: Automatic image optimization, CSS bundling, and more
- **Developer Experience**: TypeScript support, hot module reloading, and more

## Getting started

```bash
npm create astro@latest
cd my-astro-site
npm run dev
```

That's it! You now have a blazing-fast Astro site running locally.
