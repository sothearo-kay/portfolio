        Hi! I'm <strong>Sothearo</strong>, a Frontend Developer based in Phnom Penh, Cambodia.
        I enjoy turning ideas into clean, user-friendly web experiences — from sleek UI design to smooth
        interactions that make a site feel alive.

      <Paragraph>
        My work is fueled by curiosity and creativity. I'm always exploring better ways to build for the web,
        learning modern frameworks, and pushing myself to write code that's both elegant and practical.

        Outside of coding, I dive deep into the world of manga and storytelling.
        <strong>Code by day, manga by night.</strong> Stories inspire me — whether they're written in panels
        or in lines of code.
        If you're curious, here are some of my <a href="/manga" class="link">favorites</a>.
